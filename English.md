## Game principle

If we have a nearly infinite AA battery, then we can make a quantum entanglement with energy close to infinity. We can launch it into space. According to the expansion theory of the universe, this nearly infinite quantum entanglement will be reflected back. We can draw an Epirus (efficient power in real universe) according to the wavelength of return. The expansion coefficient of the universe can be obtained by calculating the semi closed value of this function. By using the CUB instrument, we can obtain an efficient energy, which we call Ji

------------
## Rules of the game

Each character has n drops of blood at the beginning, and then begins the game

### Priority principle:

1. Game skills are settled according to the priority. If the priority is the same, it will be settled at the same time
1. The priority is 3
1. Attacks with the same priority can cancel each other, while attacks with higher priority can prevent attacks with lower priority

### About "Loan"

"Loan" refers to the use of skills when there is not enough energy. In principle, the phenomenon of loan should not appear. If it does, it should be handled according to the following methods:

1. Consume all existing Ep, and the skill of this round is invalid
1. For every extra two Ep consumed, one drop of blood is reduced

------------
## Game mode

Here are just a few of the patterns that use more people
1. Standard mode: all skills can be used. Each character has 3 HP at the initial stage
1. Fast mode: you can only use "Ji", "Gun" and "Defense". Each character has 3 HP in the initial stage
1. Emperor of Europe mode: you can only use the three skills of "Ji", "Vajra shield" and "Eight trigrams array". Each character has HP at the initial stage
1. Vampire mode: can use all skills, each deduction of each other's blood, you can recover a drop of blood, each character has 2HP or 1HP at the initial stage
